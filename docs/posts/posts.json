Consistency of design allows for easier sharing (you or other collaborators  don't have to look for things) and reduces some cognitive load by allowing you to focus on content and less on form. This is my lightly opinionated project structure. Of course these fews are ever evolving.",

One such metric is sensitivity, which is a measure of those who are actually targets how many does the model correctly identify. This can be the metric of choice over accuracy when you are dealing with a raw event such as a terrorist attack or even student retention. It is always important to understand what metrics you are optimising your models on.",
