    "description": "Item Response Theory (IRT) is a method by which item difficulty is assessed and used to measure latent factors. Classical test theory has a shortcoming where the test-taker's ability and the difficulty of the item cannot be separated. Thus there is a question of universalisability outside of the instrument. Additionally, the models make some assumptions that mathematically may not be justified. In come IRT which handles some of these issues.\n",
